# Weather-Dashboard-APIs

## Description 
* Created an application to give the weather forcast for up to 5 days. I used an API from openweathermap.org that was given in the directions to get weather information from which ever city. I started in the html creating a layout of with classes and ids as references. In the JS script, I made universal constant variables with my key and the api url. 
Next creating functions to run the api depending on the city wanting to be searched by the user. I created a function to run the 5 day forecast in the script file so the html would not have to be so repeatative. Lastly I created a function to save search history of chosen city or location to be saved in a list.
